This is the React client for Route Assistant (Vite).

Notes:
- The server injects the Google Maps API key by replacing __GOOGLE_API_KEY__ in client/dist/index.html
- Run `npm run build` in this folder, then start the server from the repo root.
- To add shadcn/ui components later: install Tailwind and run the shadcn CLI to generate components.
