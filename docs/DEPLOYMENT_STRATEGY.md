# Deployment Strategy and Release Management

## Overview
This document outlines the source control strategy and deployment process for the Route Assistant application, enabling stable production deployments while maintaining active development.

## Source Control Strategy

### Branch Structure

#### Main Branches
- **`main`** - Production-ready code, always deployable
  - Protected branch with required reviews
  - Only accepts merges from `release/*` branches
  - Tagged with version numbers for releases
  - Automatically deployed to production

- **`develop`** - Integration branch for ongoing development
  - Default branch for feature development
  - Contains latest development features
  - May be unstable, not suitable for production
  - Automatically deployed to staging environment

#### Supporting Branches

- **`feature/*`** - Individual feature development
  - Branch from: `develop`
  - Merge back to: `develop`
  - Naming: `feature/description-of-feature`
  - Example: `feature/poi-search-improvements`

- **`release/*`** - Prepare new production releases
  - Branch from: `develop`
  - Merge to: `main` and `develop`
  - Naming: `release/v1.2.3`
  - Used for final testing and bug fixes before release

- **`hotfix/*`** - Critical production fixes
  - Branch from: `main`
  - Merge to: `main` and `develop`
  - Naming: `hotfix/v1.2.4`
  - For urgent fixes that can't wait for next release cycle

### Workflow Examples

#### Feature Development
```bash
# Start new feature
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b feature/enhanced-elevation-chart

# Work on feature...
git add .
git commit -m "Add interactive elevation chart hover"

# Push and create PR to develop
git push origin feature/enhanced-elevation-chart
```

#### Release Process
```bash
# Create release branch
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b release/v1.3.0

# Final testing and bug fixes...
git commit -m "Fix: minor UI alignment issues"

# Merge to main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge --no-ff release/v1.3.0
git tag -a v1.3.0 -m "Release version 1.3.0"
git push origin main --tags

# Merge back to develop
git checkout develop
git merge --no-ff release/v1.3.0
git push origin develop

# Clean up
git branch -d release/v1.3.0
git push origin --delete release/v1.3.0
```

#### Hotfix Process
```bash
# Create hotfix from main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b hotfix/v1.2.4

# Fix critical issue...
git commit -m "Fix: critical POI search crash"

# Merge to main and tag
git checkout main
git merge --no-ff hotfix/v1.2.4
git tag -a v1.2.4 -m "Hotfix version 1.2.4"
git push origin main --tags

# Merge to develop
git checkout develop
git merge --no-ff hotfix/v1.2.4
git push origin develop

# Clean up
git branch -d hotfix/v1.2.4
git push origin --delete hotfix/v1.2.4
```

## Best Practices

### Development
- Keep feature branches small and focused
- Write meaningful commit messages
- Use conventional commit format when possible
- Regularly sync with `develop` branch
- Test locally before pushing

### Code Review
- All changes require peer review
- Review for functionality, security, and performance
- Verify tests cover new functionality
- Check for breaking changes

### Release Management
- Plan releases regularly (e.g., bi-weekly)
- Batch related features together
- Allow time for thorough testing
- Communicate release schedule to team

### Documentation
- Keep this document updated
- Document breaking changes
- Maintain accurate README
- Update API documentation

## Quick Reference Commands

```bash
# Setup development branch structure
git checkout -b develop
git push -u origin develop

# Start new feature
git checkout develop && git checkout -b feature/my-feature

# Create release
git checkout develop && git checkout -b release/v1.2.0

# Tag and deploy
git tag -a v1.2.0 -m "Release v1.2.0"
git push origin main --tags

# Emergency hotfix
git checkout main && git checkout -b hotfix/v1.2.1
```

This strategy ensures stable deployments while maintaining development velocity and provides clear procedures for handling both planned releases and emergency situations.
