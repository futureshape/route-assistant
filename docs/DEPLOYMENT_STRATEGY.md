# Simple Deployment Strategy for Solo Development

## Overview
This is a streamlined deployment approach for solo development with GitHub Copilot, focusing on simplicity while enabling stable production deployments.

## Simple Source Control Strategy

### Main Workflow
- **`main`** branch is your primary development branch
- Work directly on `main` for small changes and fixes
- Use `feature/*` branches only for bigger experimental changes
- Tag stable points for releases

### When to Use Feature Branches
Only create feature branches for:
- **Large experimental features** that might take days/weeks
- **Breaking changes** that you want to test thoroughly
- **Major refactoring** that might destabilize the app
- **Anything you're not sure about** and want to experiment with

Example:
```bash
# For big changes only
git checkout -b feature/major-ui-redesign
# Work on big changes...
git checkout main
git merge feature/major-ui-redesign
git branch -d feature/major-ui-redesign
```

## Simple Release Process

### 1. When Ready to Deploy
```bash
# Make sure main is stable
npm run build
npm test  # if you have tests

# Tag the release
git tag -a v1.2.3 -m "Release v1.2.3: Add elevation chart improvements"
git push origin v1.2.3
```

### 2. Deploy the Tagged Version
- Deploy the specific tag to production
- Keep `main` for continued development
- If issues arise, either hotfix or rollback to previous tag

## Pre-Deployment Checklist (Simple)

### Essential Checks
- [ ] App builds without errors (`npm run build`)
- [ ] Basic functionality works in dev mode
- [ ] No console errors on main features
- [ ] Environment variables ready for production

### Quick Manual Test
- [ ] Can sign in with RideWithGPS
- [ ] Can load and select a route
- [ ] POI search works (try one provider)
- [ ] Map displays correctly
- [ ] No obvious UI breaks

### Before Tagging
- [ ] Update version in `package.json`
- [ ] Add entry to `CHANGELOG.md` (create if needed)
- [ ] Commit any final changes

## Deployment Environments

### Development
- **Where**: Local (`npm run dev`)
- **When**: All the time while developing

### Production
- **Where**: Your chosen platform (Vercel recommended)
- **When**: Deploy tagged releases
- **How**: Platform deploys specific git tags

## Simple Version Numbering

Keep it simple:
- `v1.0.0` - First stable release
- `v1.1.0` - New features added
- `v1.1.1` - Bug fixes
- `v2.0.0` - Major changes or breaking changes

## Recommended Platform Setup

### Vercel (Easiest for React) ‚≠ê Recommended
Vercel is perfect for this setup because it can automatically deploy when you push tags.

**Setup Steps:**
1. **Connect Repository**: Link your GitHub repo to Vercel
2. **Configure Production Deployments**:
   - Go to Project Settings ‚Üí Git
   - Set "Production Branch" to: **Use a different ref for the Production deployment**
   - Select **"Git Tag"** option
   - Pattern: `v*` (matches v1.0.0, v1.1.0, etc.)
3. **Set Environment Variables** in Vercel dashboard
4. **Deploy Process**: When you push a tag, Vercel automatically deploys it to production

**Your Workflow:**
```bash
# When ready to deploy
npm run deploy-check
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release v1.0.0"
git push origin v1.0.0
# Vercel automatically deploys v1.0.0 to production! üöÄ
```

### Netlify (Great Alternative)
**Setup Steps:**
1. **Connect Repository**: Link your GitHub repo to Netlify
2. **Configure Deploy Settings**:
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `dist`
   - Production branch: Leave as `main` initially
3. **Set up Deploy Hooks**:
   - Go to Site Settings ‚Üí Build & deploy ‚Üí Deploy hooks
   - Create a new hook for "Production deploys"
   - Use GitHub Actions to trigger on tags (see below)

### Railway (Full-stack with database)
**Setup Steps:**
1. **Connect Repository**: Link your GitHub repo to Railway
2. **Auto-deployment**: Railway deploys from `main` by default
3. **Manual Deployments**: Use Railway CLI to deploy specific tags
```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Deploy specific tag
git checkout v1.0.0
railway up
```

### GitHub Actions + Any Platform
If your platform doesn't support tag-based deployments, use GitHub Actions:

**Create `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:**
```yaml
name: Deploy on Tag
on:
  push:
    tags:
      - 'v*'

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run build
      - name: Deploy to your platform
        run: |
          # Add your platform's deployment command here
          # Examples:
          # npx vercel --prod --token ${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
          # npx netlify deploy --prod --auth ${{ secrets.NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN }}
          # curl -X POST ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_WEBHOOK_URL }}
```

### Environment Variables
```env
RIDEWITHGPS_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
RIDEWITHGPS_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_google_maps_key
SESSION_SECRET=random_secure_string
NODE_ENV=production
RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MINUTES=15   # Optional override; default 15-minute window
RATE_LIMIT_MAX=100             # Optional override; default 100 reqs/window (prod)
TRUST_PROXY=true               # Enable if running behind a load balancer/CDN
```

- `RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MINUTES` and `RATE_LIMIT_MAX` let you tune throttling limits without code changes (production defaults are 15 minutes / 100 requests; development uses a higher max automatically). Set `RATE_LIMIT_DEBUG=1` temporarily if you need verbose logging when diagnosing limit events.
- `TRUST_PROXY` should be enabled (e.g., `true`, `1`, or a hop count) when Express is running behind a proxy or CDN so client IP addresses are detected correctly for rate limiting and logging.

## Testing Your Deployment Setup

### 1. Test with a Pre-release Tag
```bash
# Create a test release to verify the setup works
git tag -a v0.9.0-beta -m "Test deployment setup"
git push origin v0.9.0-beta

# Check if your platform automatically deployed it
# Then delete the test tag
git tag -d v0.9.0-beta
git push origin --delete v0.9.0-beta
```

### 2. Verify Environment Variables
- Check that your app loads without console errors
- Test RideWithGPS authentication
- Verify Google Maps displays correctly
- Test POI search functionality

### 3. Monitor First Real Deployment
```bash
# Your first real release
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "First stable release"
git push origin v1.0.0

# Watch your platform's deployment logs
# Test all critical functionality
# Keep the previous working version handy for rollback
```

## If Something Goes Wrong

### Production Issue
1. **Quick fix needed?**
   - Fix on `main`
   - Tag new version
   - Deploy new tag

2. **Complex issue?**
   - Revert to previous working tag
   - Fix properly on `main`
   - Tag and deploy when ready

### Rollback Process
```bash
# Find previous working version
git tag --list
git log --oneline

# Deploy previous tag through your platform
# Or temporarily revert commits on main
git revert <problematic-commit-hash>
git tag -a v1.2.4 -m "Hotfix: revert problematic change"
git push origin v1.2.4
```

## Daily Workflow Examples

### Regular Development
```bash
# Just work on main
git add .
git commit -m "improve POI search performance"
git push origin main

# When ready to release
git tag -a v1.3.0 -m "Release v1.3.0"
git push origin v1.3.0
```

### Experimental Feature
```bash
# Only for big uncertain changes
git checkout -b feature/experimental-maps-api
# Experiment...
git add .
git commit -m "try new maps implementation"

# If it works
git checkout main
git merge feature/experimental-maps-api
git branch -d feature/experimental-maps-api

# If it doesn't work
git checkout main
git branch -D feature/experimental-maps-api  # Delete without merging
```

## Tools to Make Life Easier

### Package.json Scripts
Add these to make deployment easier:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "vite build",
    "preview": "vite preview",
    "deploy-check": "npm run build && echo 'Build successful - ready to tag and deploy'",
    "tag-release": "read -p 'Version (e.g., v1.2.3): ' version && git tag -a $version -m \"Release $version\" && git push origin $version"
  }
}
```

Usage:
```bash
npm run deploy-check  # Quick build test
npm run tag-release   # Interactive tag creation
```

### Simple CHANGELOG.md
Keep track of what you deployed:
```markdown
# Changelog

## v1.3.0 - 2025-10-02
- Added interactive elevation chart
- Fixed POI search bug with empty results
- Improved mobile responsive design

## v1.2.0 - 2025-09-28
- Added OSM POI provider
- Enhanced route selection with search
- Fixed authentication flow issues
```

## Monitoring (Keep It Simple)

### Essential Monitoring
- Set up basic uptime monitoring (UptimeRobot is free)
- Use your platform's built-in analytics (Vercel Analytics)
- Check error logs in your platform dashboard

### When to Check
- After each deployment
- Weekly health check
- When users report issues

## Key Principles

1. **Keep `main` stable** - Don't push broken code
2. **Tag when ready** - Only tag versions you'd be happy to deploy
3. **Small frequent releases** - Better than big scary deployments
4. **Test before tagging** - Run the essential checks
5. **Document what changed** - Future you will thank you

This approach gives you stable deployments without the complexity of managing multiple long-lived branches or complicated workflows.

## Quick Platform Comparison

| Platform | Tag-based Deploy | Setup Difficulty | Best For |
|----------|------------------|------------------|----------|
| **Vercel** | ‚úÖ Native support | ‚≠ê Easy | React/Next.js apps |
| **Netlify** | ‚ö° Via webhooks/actions | ‚≠ê‚≠ê Medium | Static sites + functions |
| **Railway** | üîß Manual/CLI | ‚≠ê‚≠ê Medium | Full-stack apps |
| **GitHub Pages** | ‚ö° Via actions | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Complex | Static sites only |

**Recommendation**: Start with **Vercel** - it has the best tag-based deployment support and is perfect for your React app.

## Deployment Trigger Options

### Option 1: Automatic on Tag Push (Recommended)
```bash
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release v1.0.0"
git push origin v1.0.0
# Platform automatically deploys! üöÄ
```

### Option 2: Manual Deploy with Tag
```bash
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release v1.0.0"
git push origin v1.0.0
# Then manually trigger deploy in platform dashboard
```

### Option 3: Deploy-specific Commands
```bash
# Tag the release
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release v1.0.0"
git push origin v1.0.0

# Use platform CLI to deploy the tag
vercel --prod
# or
netlify deploy --prod
# or
railway up
```
