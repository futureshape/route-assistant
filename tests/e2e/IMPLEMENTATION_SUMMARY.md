# E2E Testing Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the E2E testing implementation for Route Assistant. This implementation uses Playwright for end-to-end testing with real RideWithGPS OAuth authentication and a persistent test database.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Test Infrastructure
- **Playwright 1.56.1** installed and configured for E2E testing
- Test directory structure: `tests/e2e/`
- Configuration file: `playwright.config.ts`
- Support for Chromium browser (Firefox and WebKit commented out but available)
- **Video recording**: Configurable via `RECORD_VIDEO=always` environment variable
- **Persistent server**: `reuseExistingServer: true` maintains sessions across tests
- **Persistent database**: `.test-data/test-db.sqlite` (not in-memory)
- **Automatic route management**: Creates unique test route before tests, deletes it after all tests complete

### 2. Authentication Strategy
**Real OAuth Token Approach**:
- Tests use a real RideWithGPS OAuth token from a test account
- Backend middleware (`TEST_MODE`) intercepts requests with Authorization header
- Server fetches real user data from RideWithGPS API using the token
- User is created/fetched in local database
- Session is established with real user credentials
- All API calls work normally with actual RideWithGPS data

**Why This Approach**:
- ✅ Tests with real data (actual routes, POIs, user info)
- ✅ No need to mock RideWithGPS API responses
- ✅ Catches real API integration issues
- ✅ Simple to set up - just need one valid token
- ✅ Tests run against production-like conditions

```

### 5. Tests Implemented

**Comprehensive Test Suite** (`authentication.spec.ts`) - **11 tests total, all passing in ~14.4s**:

0. **Setup: Create unique test route** (~918ms)
   - POSTs `test-route.json` to RideWithGPS API
   - Generates unique route name with timestamp (e.g., `[E2E-TEST-1760896297078] Sample Route`)
   - Saves route name and ID to `.auth/test-route-{name,id}.txt` for tests to use
   - Ensures tests don't interfere with existing routes

1. **Setup: User authentication** (~1.0s)
   - Navigates to `/auth/test` endpoint
   - Simulates OAuth callback
   - Saves authentication state to `.auth/user.json`

2. **User can authenticate and routes are fetched** (2.6s)
   - Navigates to application
   - Verifies authentication via `data-testid="user-name"`
   - Closes intro dialog
   - Waits for routes to load
   - Verifies `/api/session` and `/api/routes` API calls

3. **Route selector combobox can open and contains the test route** (156ms)
   - Opens route selector dropdown
   - Finds the unique test route created in setup
   - Verifies route exists in the list

4. **Selecting the test route shows the route line on the map** (962ms)
   - Selects the unique test route
   - Verifies map overlay disappears
   - Confirms route points loaded (275 points in test route)
   - Validates route name displayed in selector

5. **Searching for POIs returns results from Google** (686ms)
   - Opens Google Maps POI provider
   - Searches for "coffee"
   - Verifies 20 POIs added to map
   - Tracks initial vs final POI count

6. **Clearing all suggested POIs removes them from the map** (43ms)
   - Clicks "Clear all suggested POIs" button
   - Verifies POIs removed
   - Confirms button becomes disabled

7. **Searching OSM for fuel stations and toilets returns results** (1.4s)
   - Opens OpenStreetMap POI provider
   - Selects "Fuel Station" and "Toilets" POI types
   - Searches for POIs
   - Verifies 19 POIs added to map

8. **Clicking a random marker and changing its name to a unique test ID** (245ms)
   - Gets all markers via `__testGetMarkers()` test helper
   - Filters to suggested markers (19 found)
   - Randomly selects one marker
   - Clicks marker programmatically via `__testClickMarkerByKey()`
   - Changes POI name to unique timestamp-based ID (e.g., `TEST-POI-1760892954792`)
   - Clicks "Keep" button to select POI
   - Verifies selected count increased

9. **Sending POIs to RideWithGPS and verifying persistence after reload** (2.9s)
   - Captures initial state: 1 selected POI, 2 existing POIs
   - Finds and verifies "Send to RideWithGPS" button is visible and enabled
   - Clicks send button
   - Waits for success `alertdialog` to appear
   - Verifies success message: "Successfully sent X new POI(s) to RideWithGPS!"
   - Dismisses dialog by clicking "OK" button
   - Waits for automatic route reload (2s)
   - Verifies existing POI count increased correctly (2 → 3)
   - Verifies unique test POI now exists in route as "existing" POI
   - Confirms pre-existing POIs were preserved during the operation

10. **Teardown: Delete test route** (~583ms)
   - Reads route ID from `.auth/test-route-id.txt`
   - Sends DELETE request to RideWithGPS API
   - Removes cleanup files
   - Runs automatically after all tests (successful or failed)

**Test Architecture**:
- **Unique route creation**: Each test run creates a fresh route with timestamp-based unique name
- **Automatic cleanup**: Test routes are deleted after all tests complete (successful or failed)
- **Sequential execution**: Tests run in order using `test.describe.serial()`
- **Shared page context**: All tests share single page instance created in `beforeAll()`
- **State preservation**: Route selection, POI searches, and selections persist across tests
- **Performance optimized**: Setup steps run in parallel, tests run sequentially
- **Safe testing**: Tests use dedicated routes, auto-cleanup prevents route accumulation
- **Full workflow coverage**: Complete user journey from route creation → authentication → POI search → selection → sending to RideWithGPS → verification of persistence

**Test Data Used**:
- Test user: Alex Baxevanis (RideWithGPS user ID 1625496)
- Test route: Dynamically created from `test-route.json` with unique name
- Route template: 275 points, ~7.8km cycling route in London area
- Real OAuth token stored in `.env.test`

## Marker Testing Infrastructure (Phase 1)

### Test Helper Functions
Exposed on `window` object for programmatic marker interaction:

- **`__testClickMarkerByName(poiName: string)`** - Click marker by POI name
- **`__testClickMarkerByIndex(index: number)`** - Click marker by array index
- **`__testClickMarkerByKey(markerKey: string)`** - Click marker by unique key
- **`__testGetMarkers()`** - Return array of all markers with metadata

### Data Attributes
Added to `MapContainer` component for verification:
- `data-suggested-count` - Count of suggested POIs
- `data-selected-count` - Count of selected POIs
- `data-existing-count` - Count of existing POIs from RideWithGPS
- `data-marker-info` - JSON array of all markers with state/position
- `data-poi-count`, `data-route-loaded`, `data-route-points` - Map state

### POI Info Window Test IDs
Added to `POIInfoWindow` component:
- `data-testid="poi-info-window"` - Main info window container
- `data-poi-key` - Unique marker identifier
- `data-poi-name` - POI name
- `data-poi-state` - Current state (suggested/selected/existing)
- `data-testid="poi-name-input"` - Editable name field
- `data-testid="poi-keep-button"` - Select POI button
- `data-testid="poi-remove-button"` - Deselect POI button
- `data-testid="poi-existing-label"` - Existing POI indicator

### POI Summary Test IDs
Added to `POISummary` component:
- `data-testid="send-pois-button"` - Send to RideWithGPS button

**Rationale**: Google Maps markers aren't regular DOM elements, so programmatic clicking via JavaScript functions is required instead of Playwright selectors. See `tests/e2e/MARKER_TESTING_PROPOSAL.md` for detailed technical approach.

## How It Works

### Authentication Flow

```
1. Test starts → Playwright config sets TEST_MODE=true
2. Route creation → POSTs test-route.json to RideWithGPS
3. Unique route name → [E2E-TEST-{timestamp}] Sample Route
4. Auth setup runs → Sets Authorization header with real token
5. Request hits backend → TEST_MODE middleware intercepts
6. Server validates token → Matches TEST_OAUTH_TOKEN env var
7. Server fetches user → Calls RideWithGPS API /user.json
8. User added to DB → Creates/updates user in local database
9. Session created → req.session populated with real data
10. Tests run → Use unique route name from .auth/test-route-name.txt
```

### Test Execution Flow

```
1. Setup Project 1 → Create unique route (~944ms)
   - Reads test-route.json template
   - Generates unique name with timestamp
   - POSTs to RideWithGPS API
   - Saves route name and ID to .auth/test-route-{name,id}.txt

2. Setup Project 2 → Authenticate (~1.6s)
   - Depends on route creation
   - Navigates to /auth/test endpoint
   - Saves auth state to .auth/user.json

3. Test Projects → Run tests with auth state (~8.3s)
   - Chromium tests use saved authentication
   - Read unique route name from file
   - Load and interact with the test route
   - Fast sequential execution with shared page

4. Teardown Project → Delete test route (~594ms)
   - Runs after all tests (even if tests failed)
   - Reads route ID from file
   - DELETEs route via RideWithGPS API
   - Removes cleanup files
```

## Setup Requirements

### For Developers

1. **Get OAuth Token**:
   - Sign in to app locally
   - Extract token from browser/session (see GETTING_OAUTH_TOKEN.md)
   
2. **Configure Environment**:
   ```bash
   # Add to .env
   TEST_MODE=true
   TEST_OAUTH_TOKEN=your-real-token-here
   ```

3. **Run Tests**:
   ```bash
   npm run test:e2e
   ```

### For CI/CD

1. **GitHub Secrets**:
   - Add `TEST_OAUTH_TOKEN` as repository secret
   - Token should be from dedicated test account
   
2. **Workflow** (future):
   ```yaml
   - name: Run E2E Tests
     env:
       TEST_MODE: true
       TEST_OAUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.TEST_OAUTH_TOKEN }}
     run: npm run test:e2e
   ```

### 🚧 Infrastructure Ready, Not Yet Tested

### 🔮 Future Enhancements
- Route switching with unsaved changes dialog
- Elevation chart interactions
- Error handling scenarios
- Mobile viewport tests
- Firefox/WebKit browser tests
- CI/CD integration
- Visual regression testing

## Known Limitations

1. **Token Expiration**: OAuth tokens expire after ~60 days. Need to refresh periodically.
2. **Cleanup Dependency**: If cleanup fails (network error, API issue), route may remain. Manual cleanup may be needed rarely.
3. **API Rate Limits**: Using real API means tests count toward RideWithGPS rate limits.
4. **Google Maps API**: Tests require valid GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY for map features.
5. **Single Browser**: Currently only configured for Chromium (Firefox/WebKit available but disabled).
6. **Sequential Execution**: Tests must run in order due to shared state (not fully isolated).

## Future Enhancements

### Short Term
- ✅ POI search and addition tests (COMPLETED)
- ✅ Random marker selection tests (COMPLETED)
- Add POI persistence after reload test (infrastructure ready)
- Test sending POIs to RideWithGPS (when user ready)
- Add error scenarios (no routes, API failures)
- Test mobile viewports

### Medium Term
- Add visual regression testing
- Enable CI/CD integration (GitHub Actions)
- Enable Firefox and WebKit browsers
- Add performance monitoring
- Implement test database seeding with known data

### Long Term
- Mock external services (Google Maps, RideWithGPS) for faster tests
- Generate comprehensive test reports
- Add accessibility testing (a11y)
- Create test data fixtures
- Add screenshot comparisons
- Implement parallel test execution with isolated state

## Maintenance Notes

### When OAuth Token Expires
1. Sign in to app with test account
2. Extract new token (see GETTING_OAUTH_TOKEN.md)
3. Update .env: `TEST_OAUTH_TOKEN=new-token`
4. Update CI/CD secret if applicable

### Adding New Tests
1. Create `.spec.ts` file in `tests/e2e/` OR add to existing `authentication.spec.ts`
2. Import test framework: `import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test'`
3. Use shared page context if adding to sequential suite
4. Add test IDs to components if needed (`data-testid="component-name"`)
5. For marker interactions, use test helper functions (`__testClickMarkerByKey`, etc.)
6. Run with `npm run test:e2e` or `npm run test:e2e:ui`

**Test Helper Functions for Marker Testing**:
```typescript
// Get all markers
const markers = await page.evaluate(() => (window as any).__testGetMarkers());

// Click by unique key (recommended)
await page.evaluate((key) => (window as any).__testClickMarkerByKey(key), markerKey);

// Click by name
await page.evaluate((name) => (window as any).__testClickMarkerByName(name), 'Coffee Shop');

// Click by index
await page.evaluate((idx) => (window as any).__testClickMarkerByIndex(idx), 0);
```

### Debugging Failed Tests
1. Run with UI: `npm run test:e2e:ui`
2. Run with headed mode: `npm run test:e2e:headed`
3. Check screenshots: `test-results/*/test-failed-*.png`
4. Watch videos: `test-results/*/video.webm` (or record all with `npm run test:e2e:video`)
5. View HTML report: `npm run test:e2e:report`
6. Use debug mode: `npm run test:e2e:debug`
7. Check test output in terminal for console.log statements

**Performance Metrics** (as of latest run):
- Total execution time: ~12.8s for 10 tests (includes 2 setup + 8 tests + 1 teardown)
- Route creation: ~944ms
- Authentication: ~1.6s  
- Main tests: ~8.3s (8 tests)
- Route cleanup: ~594ms
- Sequential execution with shared page maintains state and reduces setup overhead
- Each test run creates a fresh, isolated route and cleans it up automatically
